# Agent Learn

A central repository for learning, experimenting with, and comparing various AI agent frameworks.

## Overview

Agent Learn serves as a collection of implementations, examples, and learning resources for different AI agent frameworks. It aims to provide a consistent environment for exploring agent architectures, making it easier to understand their strengths and use cases.

## Current AI Agent Examples

### Smolagents

The repository currently includes [smolagents](https://github.com/huangyingting/agent-learn/smolagens-learn) examples, smolagents is a library that enables you to run powerful agents in a few lines of code.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.10 or higher
2. [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for Python package management

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huangyingting/agent-learn.git
cd agent-learn
uv sync
```

## Usage

### Smolagents

For more detailed examples, check the `smolagents-learn` directory.

## Future Plans

- Add implementations for additional agent frameworks:
  - LangChain
  - Autogen
  - OpenAI Agents
- Provide comparative analyses between different frameworks
- Include benchmarking tools for agent performance

## Contributing
