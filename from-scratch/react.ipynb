    "ReAct agent is an AI agent that follows the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) framework, which combines chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning with external tool use. This approach allows AI models to dynamically plan, execute, and adapt their actions based on new information, rather than following predefined workflows"
