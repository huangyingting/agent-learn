    "### Implementing ReAct Agent with a Custom TAO Parser\n",
    "\n",
    "When an LLM does not natively support structured function calling, or when more direct control over the \"Thought,\" \"Action,\" and \"Observation\" (TAO) flow is desired, a custom parser implementation becomes necessary. This approach relies on prompting the LLM to produce its reasoning and intended actions in a specific text format, which is then parsed by the agent's code.   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Use a Custom Parser\n",
    "\n",
    "A custom TAO parser is suitable when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The chosen LLM lacks native function calling capabilities (e.g., many open-source models or older proprietary models).   \n",
    "- A model-agnostic approach to tool use is preferred, allowing easier switching between different LLMs.\n",
    "- Fine-grained control over the textual representation of thoughts and actions is required, - potentially deviating from standard function call JSON structures.\n",
    "- The explicit generation of \"Thought\" strings before \"Action\" strings is a primary design goal, aligning closely with the original ReAct paper's emphasis on interpretability."
